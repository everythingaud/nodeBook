# NodeBook
An electron based collaborative text editor.

## About
Quickly accessing and editing documents are important for highly collaborative teams. Unfortunately, most collaborative text editors, such as Google Docs and the like, are limited to browsers. As users start to need more and more browser tabs, but tabs take up a lot of memory and even powerful computers quickly slow down. There is a real opportunity to reduce the clicks and time needed to access, edit and share documents when compared to todayâ€™s web-based alternatives. On the other hand, other desktop based apps such as Evernote and iNotes lack the real-time/collaborative nature of something like Google Docs.

This is where NodeBook comes in. NodeBook is a collaborative rich-text editing desktop application where users can create, view, edit and share documents through NodeBook.
